In traditional approaches, force rendering requires a terminal, time-consuming step of cell deadhesion to obtain a reference image. A conceptually opposite approach is provided by reference-free methods, opening to the on-the-fly generation of force maps from an ongoing experiment. This requires an image processing algorithm keeping the pace of the biological phenomena under investigation. Here, we introduce an integrated software pipeline rendering force maps from single reference-free TFM images seconds to minutes after their acquisition. The algorithm tackles image processing, reference image estimation, and finite element analysis as a single problem, yielding a robust and fully automatic solution. The method\u2019s capabilities are demonstrated in two applications. First, the mechanical annihilation of cancer cells is monitored as a function of rising environmental temperature, setting a population threshold at 45 \u00b0C. Second, the fast temporal correlation of forces produced across individual cells is used to map physically connected adhesion points, yielding typical lengths that vary as a function of the cell cycle phase. Introduction \u00b6 The Cellogram software package contains custom-developed software for the analysis of reference free traction force images. The software comprises of marker detection, reference position estimation and finite element analysis in order to compute surface traction fields. Details on the underlying algorithms are provided in the supplementary information. The entire code is contained in src/ folder. The Cellogram binary is in the binary/ folder (there is no need to compile the code). A folder with examples of deformed quantum dot arrays and pillars are provided in the data/ folder. Requirements \u00b6 Cellogram does not require any commercial software and was tested on Windows 10 Enterprise and Mac OS X 10.14. The executable is not signed, therefore on Mac it requires to enable the option to run untrusted applications. The simplest way is to right click on Cellogram, select \u201copen\u201d and allow it to open in any subsequent dialogues. Note that you might need to allow running apps from not coming from the apple store. To do so, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy the General tab and click the App Store and identified developers radio button (this step requires admin priviledges).

First, click on the Load Image in the UI or select File > Load Image ( Figure 1: Stage 1 - Detection ). Navigate to a grayscale image in Portable Network Graphics (png) or Tagged Image File Format (tiff) format and select and load the image. The image should appear as seen in the screenshot in Figure 1. Figure 1. Stage 1 - Detection. Marker Detection \u00b6 For the detection of the markers Gaussian are fitted in the image. The fields under Stage 1 - Detection are Sigma which determines the size of the Gaussian that are fitted. A good starting value for is 1.5 and 3 for QDs and pillars, respectively. This value may need to adjusted depending on magnification and marker size. To start detection click on the Detect button. In case markers are missed, or detected incorrectly they can be added or deleted under Advanced vertex options or with the hot-keys a and d . Reference Estimation \u00b6 The connectivity of the mesh is found by clicking on the right arrow button in Stage 1 - Detection menu ( Figure 1 ). If the meshing step finds missing or surplus markers, it fixes them. Removed markers are marked orange, while added markers are green. Should there be added marker, the user has the option to move the added marker to the correct position by clicking Move vertex in the Stage 2 - Meshing menu before proceeding. Next click on the right arrow button to relax the mesh and find the reference position. The displacements become visible ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Stage 3 - Analysis. Finite Element Analysis \u00b6 For the finite element analysis (FEA) enter the material parameters in the Stage 3 - Analysis menu. Hover the fields to get information on the individual fields and units. Next click Build volumetric mesh to generate a finer mesh for the analysis ( Figure 2 ). The density of the mesh is tuned in the Advanced mesh option see Section 4 for details. Once the mesh is available, click the right arrow button to start the FEA.

The fields under Stage 1 - Detection are Sigma which determines the size of the Gaussian that are fitted. A good starting value for is 1.5 and 3 for QDs and pillars, respectively. This value may need to adjusted depending on magnification and marker size. To start detection click on the Detect button. In case markers are missed, or detected incorrectly they can be added or deleted under Advanced vertex options or with the hot-keys a and d .","title":"Marker Detection"},{"location":"usage.html#reference-estimation","text":"The connectivity of the mesh is found by clicking on the right arrow button in Stage 1 - Detection menu ( Figure 1 ). If the meshing step finds missing or surplus markers, it fixes them. Removed markers are marked orange, while added markers are green. Should there be added marker, the user has the option to move the added marker to the correct position by clicking Move vertex in the Stage 2 - Meshing menu before proceeding.
