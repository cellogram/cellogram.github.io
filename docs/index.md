## Introduction

The Cellogram software package contains custom-developed software for
the analysis of reference free traction force images. The software
comprises of marker detection, reference position estimation and finite
element analysis in order to compute surface traction fields. Details on
the underlying algorithms are provided in the supplementary information.

The entire code is contained in `src/` folder. The Cellogram binary is
in the `binary/` folder (there is no need to compile the code).

A folder with examples of deformed quantum dot arrays and pillars are
provided in the `data/` folder.

## Documentation

Extended documentation is provided in the [documentation](documentation.md) page.
