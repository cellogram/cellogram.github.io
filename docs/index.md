!!! abstract
    Traction force microscopy (TFM) derives maps of cell-generated forces, typically in the nanonewton range, transmitted to the extracellular environment upon actuation of complex biological processes. In traditional approaches, force rendering requires a terminal, time-consuming step of cell deadhesion to obtain a reference image. A conceptually opposite approach is provided by reference-free methods, opening to the on-the-fly generation of force maps from an ongoing experiment. This requires an image processing algorithm keeping the pace of the biological phenomena under investigation. Here, we introduce an integrated software pipeline rendering force maps from single reference-free TFM images seconds to minutes after their acquisition. The algorithm tackles image processing, reference image estimation, and finite element analysis as a single problem, yielding a robust and fully automatic solution. The method’s capabilities are demonstrated in two applications. First, the mechanical annihilation of cancer cells is monitored as a function of rising environmental temperature, setting a population threshold at 45 °C. Second, the fast temporal correlation of forces produced across individual cells is used to map physically connected adhesion points, yielding typical lengths that vary as a function of the cell cycle phase.

## Introduction

The Cellogram software package contains custom-developed software for
the analysis of reference free traction force images. The software
comprises of marker detection, reference position estimation and finite
element analysis in order to compute surface traction fields. Details on
the underlying algorithms are provided in the supplementary information.

The entire code is contained in `src/` folder. The Cellogram binary is
in the `binary/` folder (there is no need to compile the code).
A folder with examples of deformed quantum dot arrays and pillars are
provided in the `data/` folder.

## Requirements

Cellogram does not require any commercial software and was tested on
Windows 10 Enterprise and Mac OS X 10.14. The executable is not signed,
therefore on Mac it requires to enable the option to run untrusted
applications. The simplest way is to right click on Cellogram, select
"open" and allow it to open in any subsequent dialogues. Note that you
might need to allow running apps from not coming from the apple store.
To do so, go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy` the
General tab and click the `App Store and identified developers` radio
button (this step requires admin priviledges).
