# Stage 2 - Meshing

In this stage, Cellogram has found a valid connectivity of the mesh and
cleaned up incorrectly detected markers. Additionally it has added
points that were missed during the detection.

-   Move vertex

    In case there were previously undetected points added, the button to
    move points appears. Move the points to their exact position by
    clicking and dragging them.
