### Results

-   View (drop down)

    Select the displayed metric. Either `U` for displacements, or
    `T` for tractions.

-   Uview (drop down)

    Select the element of the metric to display. Either the magnitude or
    one of the directional components.

-   Smooth results

    Toggle between the solution and a smoothed version of the solution.
    In the smoothed version, the constant elements are replaced by
    linear elements interpolated from their vertices.

-   Colorbar

    Indicates the value corresponding to the colors. For displacements
    in μm, for tractions in *kPa*. For pillars, the value given is in
    *μN*.
